# New Architecture Compatibility

This library is **100% JavaScript/TypeScript** with no native modules, making it automatically compatible with React Native's New Architecture.

## Why This Works

Since `react-native-email-autocorrect` is a pure JavaScript library:

1. **No Bridge Communication** - All logic runs in JavaScript, no native calls needed
2. **No Native Modules** - No TurboModules migration required
3. **No UI Components** - Uses only React Native's built-in components
4. **Zero Native Dependencies** - Works identically on old and new architecture

## Compatibility

✅ **Old Architecture** (React Native < 0.76)
- Works perfectly with the bridge-based architecture
- No configuration needed

✅ **New Architecture** (React Native 0.76+)
- Automatically compatible with JSI, Fabric, and TurboModules
- No migration needed
- No `newArchEnabled` flag required

## Performance Benefits

Even though we don't use native modules, the library benefits from the New Architecture:

- **Faster JS execution** with Hermes engine improvements
- **Better memory management** in React Native 0.80+
- **Improved rendering** of suggestion UI with Fabric
- **Synchronous state updates** for better UX

## Testing with New Architecture

To test with New Architecture enabled:

```bash
# React Native 0.76+
npx react-native init TestApp
cd TestApp

# New Architecture is enabled by default in 0.76+
# For older versions, enable it manually:
# iOS: Set RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 
# Android: Set newArchEnabled=true in gradle.properties

yarn add react-native-email-autocorrect

# Run the app
yarn ios
# or
yarn android
```

## Future Enhancements

While the library works great as pure JS, potential native optimizations could include:

1. **TurboModule for Keyboard Detection** - Native keyboard type detection
2. **Fabric Component for Inline Suggestions** - Native suggestion overlay
3. **JSI for Pattern Matching** - Ultra-fast C++ string matching

These would be optional performance enhancements, not requirements.

## Summary

This library is future-proof and works seamlessly with:
- React Native 0.70 - 0.80+
- Old Bridge Architecture
- New Architecture (JSI, Fabric, TurboModules)
- No configuration or migration needed!
